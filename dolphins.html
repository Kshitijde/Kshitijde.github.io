				<p>Stay home, stay safe. With Mumbaikars staying in due to all the advisories and of course, Janta Curfew, the environment is being blessed. We have been witnessing clear skies, clean air and even can hear the birds chirping now. Which honestly is rare for Mumbaikars. Isn't it?!</p>
				<p>One more good news is that dolphins have come to play. Spotted near Marine Drive, Chowpatty, Breach Candy Club, etc, these dollies are having a gala time because there is no human interference. Not only Juhi Chawla, but other Mumbaikars too shared images and videos on Twitter of dolphins jumping and playing in the water.</p> 	
				<p>Isn't it fun to watch them play like this in cleaner waters? While we are staying in, nature is stepping out.</p>
				<p>And it is not only here in Mumbai, but across the globe that we are witnessing animals, birds and Mother Nature take a breather from havoc created by humans.
				So keep staying in, take all the necessary precautions, and let's beat this global pandemic together as one. </p>
