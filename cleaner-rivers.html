				<p>Human activities and irresponsible disposal of industrial waste have resulted in the sad plight of the Yamuna River in the last decade or so. The toxins in the river affect marine life and inhabitants living on the shores beyond comprehension as people have accepted this sad reality.</p>

				<p>However, the last few weeks have been a blessing in disguise for the tainted rivers, especially the Yamuna river which had to bear the brunt of irresponsible human activities.</p>

				<p>As the country is undergoing a 21-day lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic, the complexion of the pious river has changed. There are no foamy deposits of toxins and the river looks visibly clean.</p>


				<p>According to the vice-chairman of Delhi Jal Board Raghav Chadha, the closure of industrial units in Delhi-NCR has resulted in an improvement in water quality. There are no industrial pollutants or effluents being discharged into the river which contribute to about one-tenth of the water pollution in the river.</p>
