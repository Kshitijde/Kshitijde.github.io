		<p>"COVID 19 has given us an opportunity to spend quality time with our loved ones.This was a very rare thing in our fast-paced lives.We now have all the time in the world to do all those things which we wanted to do, but couldn't, because we said "I don't have time.I'm too busy".</p>
		<p>We have a chance to rediscover our long lost passions..people have indulged themselves in cooking,music,dance,art and what not!People now spend time playing ,trying out new things together as a family! People now finally make time to contact their old school friends, old college friends, old colleagues...you name it..they are strengthening their bonds unknowingly while we fight this pandemic together by staying home...as ONE.</p>
		<p>Many are even using this time to learn a new work skill...to constantly improve themselves. We are concentrating more on our personal and mental health and hygiene than ever as we try to stay fit at home. So is covid 19 necessarily only a bad thing? We need to remember to make the best out of the given situation and maintain a positive attitude towards life! Attitude is a small thing that makes a BIG difference"</p></div>
