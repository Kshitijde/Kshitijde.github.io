				<p>Since decades, people living in plains in India had been visiting the mountains to soothe their senses. For many city dwellers in North India, visiting the snow-capped Himalayan peaks means going beyond Rishikesh in Uttarakhand at least.</p>

				<p>But ever since India has been locked down to control the Coronavirus, nature has surprised us by showing how well it has been cleaning the environment silently.</p>

				<p>A short time back, as the air pollution dropped, the Dhauladhar mountain range has become visible for the residents of Jalandhar city in Punjab after decades. On the other hand, people in Srinagar, Kashmir, could see the Pir Panjal Mountains more clearly.
				</p>

				<p>And lately, the locals of Saharanpur city in Uttar Pradesh were amazed to see the snow peaks of Gangotri right from their terrace and balconies.
