				<p>At present, the country is undergoing a difficult phase, and observing a complete lockdown, due to the widespread of coronavirus. On the contrary, the Mother Nature is rejoicing with the move as the people are tucked at their homes giving her a chance to relax and heal from all the pollution caused by the humans over past many years.</p>

				<p>All over the world,we can see ample satisfying proofs of the same!People are even mesmerized as they can see flock of birds in their surrounding which were once nowhere to be seen.The Nilgai(blue bull) was spotted in Noida</p>

				<p>The Kharali Haanh (lesser whistling duck) was spotted wading in the lake of Dighalipukhuri.“We were used to seeing several species of local and migratory waterfowl in Dighalipukhuri when we were young. They have returned after decades possibly because there aren’t any humans around to interfere because of the lockdown,” said Kailash Sarma, a cultural activist who lives beside the Jorpukhuri (Twin lakes), a few metres east of Dighalipukhuri.</p>


				<p>All around the world..similar sights are seen.A herd of goats was spotted in the seaside town of Llandudno, North Wales.A lone peacock was seen  cruising through the streets in a normally bustling retail area of Dubai.Florida’s popular Duval Street, which would normally be teeming with tourists on the last week of spring break, is instead being patronised by roosters.</p>


				<p>Without human intervention amidst the lockdown,wildlife is thriving!
