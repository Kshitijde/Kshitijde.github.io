				<p>The Earth’s protective layer known as the Ozone layer is showing signs of restoration. While it may seem that the recent lockdown all over the world may have impacted the ozone layer, it is steps implemented in the Montreal Protocol (1987) that is helping in the restoration.</p>

				<p>The Montreal Protocol is a treaty that phases out the production of these numerous Ozone-depleting substances eventually stopping its production altogether. A recent research paper from the University of Colorado Boulder which was published in the journal Nature stated the observation of climate changes in the southern hemisphere specifically the air circulation indicated that the Ozone layer is healing.</p>

				<p>There is potential for the Ozone layer to recover completely, as the hole on the layer is the smallest it has ever been.</p>

				<p>Though it isn't a primary reason,as more and more humans are staying at home on account of global lockdown,this recovery process is definitely being benefitted!</p>
